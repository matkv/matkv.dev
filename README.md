This is my personal website & digital garden. It is currently under construction.

I decided to completely reset & rewrite this site, so for now, these placeholder pages will be shown.

The styling is intentionally minimalistic - the main focus should be on the content. I don't want to spend a lot of time maintaining this website because personally I think there are more interesting projects to work on.

My goal is to set up a basic framework on here - and then build a tool that will **automatically generate the content for this site** based on my notes in my Obsidian vault. I will add this functionality to my [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) CLI app. However, I am not trying to build another static site generator - this is purely for the "content" subdirectory of this hugo site. And I will try to adapt this site to make it as seamless as possible to update the content.

**Planned functionality**

- 📚 Library
    - 📖 Book reviews
    - 🎬 Movie reviews
- 🌱 Digital garden
    - Should replace my [wiki](https://wiki.matkv.dev)
- 📝 Micro blog
- 🛠 Projects (Software & music)

Instead of having "normal" blog posts, I want to focus more on the "digital garden" idea - evergreen content that I can update over time, instead of writing posts that are relevant only for a short period of time. 

And short updates / thoughts will go into the micro blog / log section.
