My personal website that I use to share my interests, hobbies and thoughts.

Built from scratch using Hugo. Icons from [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/).

The search functionality is based on [hugo-client-side-search-template](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/hugo-client-side-search-template) and uses [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) in the background for the fuzzy search.
