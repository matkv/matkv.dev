# matkv.dev

I decided to completely reset & rewrite this site. Until it is in a somewhat working state, this placeholder will be shown.

My goal is to now build a long-term way of building this website. I'm still brainstorming how I will do it exactly, but in general the idea is to use my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault as the main source for the content for this page, and my [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) CLI app will be the main "build tool" for this site.

I will implement the functionality in core to scan my whole Obsidian vault and generate the content for this Hugo site automatically & dynamically. Should be a fun & useful task to practice Go :)

In general, I will clean up the content for this site & also build the Hugo site and its styling from the ground up—maybe trying to use vibe-coding for this.

## Planned functionality
