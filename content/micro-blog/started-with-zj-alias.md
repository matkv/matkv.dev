Started working on a Zellij plugin called [zj-alias](https://github.com/matkv/zj-alias). I'm using the [Zelligo](https://gitlab.com/scabala/zelligo) library so I can write it in Go instead of Rust. 

The plugin is supposed to read my bashrc_config file in my dotfiles repo and let me show a quick pop-up window of my custom bash aliases when I'm in a terminal session in Zellij.
