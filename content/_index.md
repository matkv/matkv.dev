# 🌱 Personal website & digital garden

This is my personal website & digital garden. It is currently under construction.

I decided to completely reset & rewrite this site, so for now I only have a few placeholder entries here.

My goal is to set up a basic framework on here - and then build a tool that will **automatically generate the content for this site** based on my notes in my Obsidian vault. I will add this functionality to my [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) CLI app. However, I am not trying to build another static site generator - this is purely for the "content" subdirectory of this hugo site. And I will try to adapt this site to make it as seamless as possible to update the content.

## Planned design & functionality

- 📚 Library
    - 📖 Book reviews
    - 🎬 Movie reviews
- 🌱 Digital garden
    - Should replace my [wiki](https://wiki.matkv.dev)
- 📝 Micro blog
- 🛠 Projects (Software & music)
- Minimalistic design, the library pages should mostly just use nicely styled tables

Instead of having "normal" blog posts, I want to focus more on the "digital garden" idea - evergreen content that I can update over time, instead of writing posts that are relevant only for a short period of time. 

And short updates & thoughts will go into the micro blog / log section.

I'm not really in a hurry to finish updating this site, but since I'm trying to get better at writing Go code anyway I will focus my efforts when working on [core](projects/core) on building the functionality to generate the content for this site.
