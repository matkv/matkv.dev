## matkv.dev

<br>
I decided to completely reset & rewrite this site. Until it is in a somewhat working state, this placeholder will be shown.

<br>
<br>

My goal is to now build a long term way of building this website. I'm still brainstorming how I will do it exactly, but in general the idea is to use my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault as the main source for the content for this page, and my [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) CLI app will be the main "build tool" for this site.

<br>

So I will implement the functionality in core to scan my whole Obsidian vault and generate the content for this hugo site automatically & dynamically. Should be a fun & useful task to practice Go :)

<br> 

In general I will clean up the content for this site & also build the hugo site and its styling from the ground up - maybe trying to use vibe-coding for this.

<br>
