It took me quite a while to finish this book even though it's only around 300 pages long. I started it once early last year but actually gave up on it because the story just didn't click with me.
Gave it another shot this year but I still struggled with it in the beginning. I tried listening to the audiobook for a bit (narrated by Carey Mulligan, loved her narration) which helped to at least get far enough into the story to keep going & finish it.

The book tells the story of Nora Seed who, after a suicide attempt, ends up in "The Midnight Library", a place between life and death. There she meets Mrs. Elm, a librarian that cared for her during her childhood. She gets to experience all the lives she could have lived if she took different decisions throughout her life by picking a book from the shelves of this library. We see how her decisions shaped the lives of the people around her in all those parralell lives & how experiencing all those lives shaped her attitude towards life in general.

Overall it was nice, not blown away by it but I did enjoy the ending & the writing style was also enjoyable. Definitely a bit predictable at times though, but all in all I enjoyed it.
