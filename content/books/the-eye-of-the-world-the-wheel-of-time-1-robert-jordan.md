Started reading this book expecting a very slow and dry read but I was suprised how easy to read and engaging this story was. The beginning was definitely a bit slow but soon the story really picks up and the characters are driven by danger and urgency.

The characters are relatable and while they do fit some stereotypes as far as fantasy books are concerned, I did not find this to be detrimental to the story.
I've heard some opinions that this is Robert Jordan's weakest book in the series as far as writing style and prose is concerned but honestly if that's the case then I'm absolutely looking forward to the rest of the series because I actually already really enjoyed the writing in this one.

The ending did feel quite rushed and came a bit too suprising for my taste but overall I liked the book and will continue with the series.
