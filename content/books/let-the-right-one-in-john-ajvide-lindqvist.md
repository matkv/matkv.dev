Really cool idea, loved the relationsship between Oskar and Eli. The general vibe and feeling in the book was definitely quite creepy. What I didn't love is that some side storylines felt kind of ill-fitting to the rest of the story and especially the flashbacks of Eli felt kind of out of place and weren't fleshed out enough. Overall I liked it but I feel like it could have been better.
