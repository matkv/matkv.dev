This book describes the experiences of a neurosurgeon during his time in medical school to residency and then in the second part how he dealt with his lung cancer diagnosis all the way up until his eventual death.

Loved the writing, obviously an incredibly heavy topic but the descriptions of his time as resident in the hospital and his motivations & reasons to become a doctor in the first place were very insightful. It is also remarkable how realistic and brave he stayed during his illness and the book also shows how the diagnosis changed the lives of not only him but also his wife.

I would absolutely recommend this book, I loved it.
