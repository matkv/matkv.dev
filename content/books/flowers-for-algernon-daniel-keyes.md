Loved the way the writing style changes simultaneously with the mental state of the main character while the story progresses, first time I read something like that. In general the ending was kind of spoiled or at least too predictable by the synopsis and general descriptions of the book.

It didn't have the deep emotional impact on me as it seems to have on a lot of readers but I would overall still absolutely recommend it.
