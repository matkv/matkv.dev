Loved it! I actually had never heard of the whole scandal with Theranos but this book was a real page turner and gave me pretty good information about the whole thing. Even though it is non-fiction the story still felt like a "normal" book and I found it very easy to follow. The author seems to have researched the topic really well and gave great insights on everything that happened.
