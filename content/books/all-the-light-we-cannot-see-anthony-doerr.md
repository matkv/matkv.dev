Loved the writing style and the way the story switches between the two different viewpoints of the main characters. I definitely remember thinking that the prose was really beautiful.

Only negative point for me personally was the ending, I felt like it would have been better if the book had ended a bit earlier, the last part felt kind of tacked on and didn't really fit with the feel of the rest of the book.
