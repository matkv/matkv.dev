After reading "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius I wanted to read another book on Stoicism. I found this one by John Sellars
to be super interesting.

It gives an overview and a basic introduction to the history & the main ideas in Stoicism, clears up some misconceptions that people might
have about this philosophy and then describes how the most important stoics came up with their ideas and how we can
apply them in our daily lives.

I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to learn more about Stoicism, I actually wish that I had read it
before starting with "Meditations".
