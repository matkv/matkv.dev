Haven't written any book reviews in more than a year so my memories aren't fresh anymore when it comes to how I felt about this book when I finished it so this review will be a short one.

Overall I remember that I thought that the fifth book in the series was really solid. We see Rand getting more independent, Mat takes over more responsibility with the "Band of the Red Hand", not a whole lot of Perrin chapters (which I'm okay with) and to be honest I don't really remember a lot of what the other characters did in detail.

I really need to write these reviews immediately after finishing the book.
