Another non-fiction book! Fairly short book by a mortician that answers weird questions asked by kids about death in a fun way. Despite the obviously pretty morbid & depressing topic the book is overall very light-hearted and fun.

There were definitely some very interesting bits of information in this book and I'd overall recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.
