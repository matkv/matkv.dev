Really disturbing book but an interesting concept. Very graphic & brutal with some (suprising) beautiful moments. Found it difficult to keep reading at first - feels like it took me a long time to finish considering it's such a short book. 

The second part of the book was way better in my opinion but I'm quite dissapointed with the ending. It felt really out of place with the values of the main character.
