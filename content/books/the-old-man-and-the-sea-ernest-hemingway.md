My first book by Ernest Hemingway. Overall I thought it was okay, definitely a fairly slow read -  not necessarily boring but the roughly 80-90 pages felt longer than they actually were.

The story is about an old man and his struggle while trying to catch & bring back home a big Marlin fish. It talks about his endurance, his stoicism and eventually the futility of his effort. I liked the parts that show his relationship with the boy that takes care of him.

Hemingway's writing style was actually pretty unremarkable for me reading it in 2022, but apparently it was pretty new and different back in the 1950s.

All in all, not blown away but I also don't regret reading it either.
