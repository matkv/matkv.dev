I've been trying to get my phone usage down & just be more mindful about my technology usage in general so I decided to read this book by Cal Newport.

Overall I liked it, at first he gave examples about other people who we commited to Digital Minimalism and talked about how, for example, social media companies are trying to gain & keep our attention for as long as possible.

The book also showed how several historical figures used their times alone to deal with the issues in their lives, such as Abraham Lincoln or Henry David Thoreau who decided to live alone in the woods for a while.

The main idea was that technology should:

1. Serve something you deeply value (offering *some* benefit is not enough)
2. Be the *best* way to use technology to serve this value (if it's not, replace it with something better)
3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies *when* and *how* you use it.

In the last part Cal Newport tries to give some advice on how to actually start *living* in a way that mirrors this mindset. I talked more about how I personally am going to try to achieve this in my [blog post](https://matkv.dev/blog/on-digital-minimalism/). 

All in all, I liked the book but it also didn't contain some crazy life changing advice. I'll have to see how well I'll be able to embrace this mindset.
