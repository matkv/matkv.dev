Here's another non-fiction book. This book is a collection of questions mostly about space, the future and technology that Stephen Hawking answers in pretty short chapters. Some questions/answers give insight to his own experiences in his life, both about his work and his personal struggle with his disability, some are about his expectations about the future, for example the impact of the advancement of A.I on humanity.

I expected this book to be drier than it actually was -  although some of his answers went into pretty heavy scientific topics, he still managed to explain them in an understandable and often very humorous way.

I also found the afterword by his daughter Lucy, written after Stephen's death, very touching, it was a great end to a cool book! Overall I think it was extremely interesting and I would definitely recommend it!
