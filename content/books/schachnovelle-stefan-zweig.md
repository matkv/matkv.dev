I read this novella pretty spontaneously because I had just really been in a "chess mood" for the last couple of days.

Overall it was surprising how much of a page turner it actually was and it was a nice to read a Austrian book for a change. 

Then again - from an emotional point of view this book hardly touched me so I'm giving it 3.5 stars I think. Worth a read but nothing exceptional in my opinion.
