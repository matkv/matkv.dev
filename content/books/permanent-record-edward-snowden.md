Absolutely loved it. Really great insights in both his personal and professional life, from his beginnings all the way to his whistle-blowing. I'm generally interested in IT & privacy concerning this topic so I found this to be a great read. 

The writing style is very easy to follow and the book was a page turner. Definitely recommend it!
