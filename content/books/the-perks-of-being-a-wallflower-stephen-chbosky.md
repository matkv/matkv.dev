Re-read this book in 2020 after reading it like 5-7 years ago. I actually remembered it to be way better than I found it now. Reading it now left me kind of underwhelmed. Overall it is a pretty nice read though and definitely has emotional moments.

This book is actually one of the rare cases where I vastly prefer the movie.
