Had high expections for this book, but it didn't quite live up to them. The premise sounded really interesting but while reading the book I just wasn't blown away by it. I'll definitely check out some other stuff from Le Guin because I've heard a lot of praise for her and I want to give it a second try.

The ending especially felt kind of like a let down. In general the pacing felt a bit off for me. But this year has been a really weak reading year for me so maybe I'm the problem, haha.
