The first part of the book describes the experiences of the author during his imprisonment in several concentration camps and talks about dealing with the situation there and finding a reason to accept & continue enduring his suffering there. Obviously some very disturbing & tragic description of events there.

The second part was about his general philosophy called Logotherapy. This was definitely more dry, but I liked that for every statement or idea he usually gave several examples of actual cases that prove and explain that idea in a more practical sense.

Overall I found it super interesting & it definitely changes one's outlook on life's meaning to a certain extent. Great book!
