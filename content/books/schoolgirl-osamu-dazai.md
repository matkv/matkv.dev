This was very short and pretty weird book. It's mostly just the thoughts and ramblings of a girl that is frustrated and looking for her purpose in life. I find it pretty hard to describe the book because there's not really a storyline, the main character is just reflecting on her current situation and her life & goals in general.

The book is definitely unique but overall I wasn't blown away a bit.
