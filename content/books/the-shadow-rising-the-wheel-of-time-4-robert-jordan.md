It took me a bit more than 4 months to finish the fourth book of the Wheel Of Time series. However I have been reading some other books on the side too. I have now decided to fully focus on the Wheel Of Time because I'm actually just a third of the way done with the whole series :D

According to Wikipedia, it is the longest book of The Wheel Of Time series even though it has fewer pages than Lord of Chaos (393 823 words).

In this book the main characters are (once again) split up. Rand goes to the Aiel Waste to learn more about the Aiel and get accepted by them as the Dragon Reborn, Egwene and Moirane/Lan also join them because Egwene is trying to improve her abilities of Dreamwalking. Perrin returns to the Two Rivers to deal with the Whitecloaks & the Trollocs (with Faile & Loial) and Nynaeve & Elayne are dealing with the Black Ajah in Tear.

Overall I really enjoyed most of the storylines and felt that the pacing was better compared to the previous books. I still really like the relationships between Faile & Perrin and Nynaeve and Elayne & co, there was also a pretty wild storyline with Tar Valon & Siuan Sanche that is now continued in book 5 as I'm reading it.

To summarise: really solid, I liked it & I'm curious to see where to story will go next (Still haven't read any major spoilers so far :D)
