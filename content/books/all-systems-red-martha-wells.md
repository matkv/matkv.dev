This book is written from the perspective of a
security bot (in a science fiction setting) which managed to
become independent. The book follows its thoughts now that it has to deal with social awkwardness, its pessimistic worldview and the human clients on
whose mission it has to protect them.

Murderbot has such a fun personality, constantly complaining about 
not being able to spend its time watching entertainment shows and trying avoiding any interaction with humans.

Really cute concept & it's overall a lighthearted & very short book so it was easy to finish. I'll probably give the other books in the series a shot! Would definitely recommend it!
