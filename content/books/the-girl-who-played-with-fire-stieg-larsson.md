As with the previous book in the Millenium trilogy, I lost motivation somewhere in the middle and once again took a break while reading it. The story just seemed a bit too unfocused in the middle of the book.

However it had a strong start & fantastic ending - it made me want to continue with the last book immediately after finishing this one. Overall I enjoyed it, the last third of the book really won me over.
