By far the longest book I've ever read (over 1800 pages on my Kindle version). I really liked it but compared to the previous 4 books I had some issues with. Overall the ending seems a bit unsatisfying because it seemed a bit rushed & most plot points have been left open (which is understandable considering this is the 5th out of 10 planned books). I would have preferred if some of those storylines would have had at least some sort of an ending.

But this is complaining on a very high level - I still love this series and am looking forward to the next 5 books.

Also, the next book in the Stormlight Archive is coming out 2031 earliest - so I'll have to wait a bit, haha.
