Decided to re-read [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/) by Jon Bodner. I started reading it a while ago but stopped at some point. This time I won't actively take so many notes and just try to absorb the information in general. Overall I think it's a good idea because while working on my utils project I'm noticing that I'm probably not doing things in an idiomatic way. So that book should probably help me with that.
