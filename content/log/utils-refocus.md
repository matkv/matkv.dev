I need to decide what I want to focus on when it comes to working on [utils](https://github.com/matkv/utils). Seems like I'm working on too many things at once while not making any real progress on any of them.

I should **focus on finishing small features** before moving on to something new & try to clean up the whole project and make it a bit more organized.
