Tired of not really having a "bigger" project to work on. I'm overall happy with working on my [utils](https://github.com/matkv/utils) CLI tool but I think I'll start checking out some open source tools in general and see if I can start contributing to them.

But I feel like that would only make sense if I'm actually using those tools.
