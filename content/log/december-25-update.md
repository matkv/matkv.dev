I've mostly been working on my [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) project recently and I've been having fun building it from the ground up again. Feels a lot cleaner this time around. 

But I have to admit that I'm getting the itch to give Rust another shot. Last time I gave up on it because I wasn't making enough progress & didn't have a clear project in mind. 

This time I'll try to first **read through the entire [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** to get a better overview of the language before starting a project. I have a vague idea of building something to make it easier copying movies to my Android TV box. And in general I'll try to use some AI tools like GitHub Copilot (but **not** the agent mode) to help me with some Rust questions.
