I created a personal wiki using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). 

I'm currently still in the process of setting everything up and learning how to use it. But overall it is a tool that let's me use markdown files (pretty much identical to how I'm already writing them in Obsidian) and creates a wiki structure with backlinks and a graph view.

I set up a separate Github repo for it, but have now in the meantime decided to make that repository private and have the content of this wiki only be accessible directly on the actual website. I'm hosting it on Cloudflare pages so it builds automatically whenever I push to the repo.

Overall I just want to move some of my more general notes on here to this new page. This blog here should be more focused on content that I personally write.

**The link to my wiki is [wiki.matkv.dev](https://wiki.matkv.dev).**
