I'm on Christmas break so I'm trying to focus on some personal projects and my hobbies. Also trying to finally make some progress on the flat search.

## Software Development

Working on [core](/projects/core) and trying to improve my Go skills in general.

Giving Rust another try. Reading through [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) slowly and once I feel like I have a grasp of the basics, I'll start with [tidysync](https://github.com/matkv/tidysync).

## Reading

Reading [Tress of the Emerald Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60531406-tress-of-the-emerald-sea) by Brandon Sanderson. Felt like reading something more light-hearted after the last couple dark/sad books.

## Fitness

Trying to get back into my regular workout routine. My knee pain is slowly but surely getting better so I'm trying to run longer / and more regularly. And for strength training I am trying to do Calisthenics workouts 3x per week.
