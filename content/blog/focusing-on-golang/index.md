After messing around with Rust for quite a while, I've decided to put that on hold for the near future at least & shift my focus (back) to learning Go.
<!--more-->

Even though I spent quite a lot of time trying to get comfortable in Rust, it has just been taking forever to get even remotely productive with it. Over the last couple of months I haven't really touched Rust at all & I've just in general kind of lost the motivation for it (for now).

However, I've been playing around with [Go](https://go.dev/) recently and it think I want to give another shot  - I've tried it already a couple years ago. Supposedly the learning curve isn't steep with Go & I already have a couple ideas for things I might use it for. I'm just starting out with a little pet project that I can use as a practice project while learning - [hugo-helper](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-helper), which is supposed to be a little CLI tool that will help me automate some common tasks for this blog.

I'm also reading [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/) by Jon Bodner and going through the examples in [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) to get a better overview of the language in general.

Overall I'm pretty excited to explore Go more :)
