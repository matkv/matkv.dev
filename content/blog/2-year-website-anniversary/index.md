I just noticed that it has been two years (8th of October 2021) since I've set up this website. Feels like that's worth a post.

I'm pretty happy with the look & functionality of the site at the moment so I probably won't mess around with it a lot in the near future at least, but I'm definitely planning to keep writing these blog posts regularly and just practice writing more. I also need to get back up to date with my book reviews, haven't really been writing them since the middle of last year I think. That's basically it, pretty happy to have a personal website :)
