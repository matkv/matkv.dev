I've been struggling to find a programming side project that I am really passionate about. In the last couple of weeks my main two projects have been this 
website & learning Rust. I did finish my little Rust [project](https://github.com/matkv/beep) that plays a sound to wake up my studio monitor speakers, but apart from that
I just keep abandoning all the side projects I start.

Today I started playing around with a C#/ASP.NET project to solve a [Knight's tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour). Maybe I'll keep working on
that in order to get a better understanding of ASP.NET because we also use this framework at work. Some ideas for the functionality that I'd like to
implement would be:

* Graphical chessboard
* Interactively position the knight on the board by clicking on any square
* Show the path that has been calculated visually by having the knight piece follow the path on the board

But to be quite honest I'm not even sure if ASP.Net is a good choice for something like this. I'll just try it out.
There are apparently several ways to solve the [Knight's tour problem with code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Finding_tours_with_computers), some are brute-force, there's a divide-and-conquer algorithm and some fancier stuff
with neural networks. I'll probably try out the **divide-and-conquer** method or the **Warnsdorff's rule**.

Or most likely I'll just forget about this project and abandon it eventually :D
