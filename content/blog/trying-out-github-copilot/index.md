Last week at work every developer got access to a **GiHub Copilot** Enterprise license. After playing around with it at work for a while, I've now decided to also get a personal license for myself to use on personal projects. I still have a couple of weeks left before I have to pay for it (there's a free trial for a month) so I'm currently trying it out and need to decide if it is actually worth it for me.

My initial impressions have been quite positive. While it isn't some mind-blowing game changer, so far it has been basically a really nice, more powerful autocomplete in the editor. Overall it felt more useful in my small pet projects than our huge project at work because there are fewer details to consider.
