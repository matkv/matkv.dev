I'm trying to write blog entries here more regularly - so I'm doing just that.
<!--more-->

Recently I've been looking at some blogs I came across on Hackernews and I stumbled upon [this post](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/#build-a-consistent-writing-habit) about 
building a consistent writing habit. This is something that I've been trying to myself over the last couple of weeks/months. While my posts here have been mostly focused on
tech/software related topics, I want to cover a more varied area of topics that I'm interested in.

I'm taking some inspiration from another blog I came across - [https://taylor.town/](https://taylor.town/) - who seems to be not have any consistent theme or vibe when it
comes to topics but nevertheless a lot of the posts are pretty interesting. And clearly the person running the blog has made it a habit to just write regularly and get
their thoughts out. Overall I **really** like these kinds of personal blogs. I love looking at how people style their sites and what content they create. Considering how 
huge & dominant the bigger social media websites are these days, I think these smaller sites really feel like a breath of fresh air.

One reason why I'm maybe hesitant to post more regularly is that I sometimes feel that some blog post ideas aren't really *worth* a post and that I don't really have
anything special to say. But that's exactly the point. 

It doesn't have to be special. It doesn't have to be the most amazing blog post ever created. If I have an interesting thought, I'm going to try to post it here. This is
my personal space on the internet so I shouldn't feel like my posts here need to have a certain level of quality to be worth publishing.
