I've once again kind of lost track of what I want to focus on when it comes to my hobbies and learning new things. This post is supposed to help me get a better overview of my goals & focus in the nearby future.

<!--more-->

- **Software development**
  - Learn Rust & Go - Continue with the Rust book & start "Learning Go (O'Reilly)" book 
  - Continue reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" & "Clean Code"
  - **Stop messing around with Neovim** and dotfiles in general so much, only change what really needs to be changed

- **Fitness**
  - Running has been going pretty well recently - keep going and slowly but surely try to work on longer distances and improving my pace
  - Get back into a **regular** strength workout routine
  - Try to eat as cleanly as possible (especially try to avoid liquid calories, prefer water over soft drinks), **don't skip the protein shake** so often

- **Reading & writing**
  - Focus on finishing Wheel Of Time exclusively now, no other books (except the ones mentioned here)
  - Try to regularly (maybe weekly) write a blog post here about any topic that's currently relevant to me. **Just practice writing.**
  - Write a short journal entry every day - works on Obsidian mobile too now, so not being on the computer is not an excuse

- **Chess**
  - Get back into playing chess regularly, all time controls except Bullet
  - Continue with "Mastering Chess Strategy" book

I'll update this post in case I forgot something important.
