After playing around with multiple editors over the last couple of years and eventually settling on Helix, I'm giving Neovim one last try using [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).

I've been using [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) as my main editor for quite a while now and have been following the updates to it pretty closely. Once I've learned enough Rust, I will maybe even try contributing to the project myself. 

Helix has become very comfortable to use for me now - especially in combination with [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/), and I've become quite fast when it comes to modal editing. The one thing that is currently still making me even consider other editors is the **lack of a plugin system**. While I understand the reasons why the main people behind Helix haven't added one yet, it simply means that Helix still lacks a lot of features that other editors don't.

This isn't a dealbreaker for me, Helix already offers a lot out of the box that a default Neovim installation doesn't have - but I've decided to try out Neovim - specifically the **NvChad** config - one more time and check if I can make it work in a way that feels comfortable to use without getting overwhelmed with configuration difficulties.

I'll probably write a post here with some updates in a couple of days!
