A quick overview of what I'm using as my personal knowledge base and to-do list.

<!--more-->

Last year in may I [wrote](/blog/trying-out-obsidian/) about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my personal knowledge base. I've actually been using it ever since and it's become a really nice tool to keep track of basically everything text based in my life that is not specifically source code.

Additionally I've also been looking for (and found) a better way to handle my to-do list and general tasks. I went from using just pen & paper in a little notebook, to using [Google Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=de_AT&gl=US), to now finally settling on [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/home).

And just this week I've been looking into a better way to save articles for reading them later and I've stumbled upon [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/home).

## Obsidian

Obsidian has become one of my most used pieces of software these days. I've moved basically any type of text-based documents into my Obsidian vault. A week or two ago I finally made the leap to buy Obsidian Sync.
