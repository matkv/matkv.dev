Since I've been struggling to find programming projects that I'm passionate about, I've decided to invest some time and 
rebuild this site from the ground up.

### Goals

- Completely rebuild the whole site
- Set up the archetypes completely clean and really think about a good setup
- Put effort into having clean CSS and reusing classes where possble
  - Maybe I'll use Tailwind for CSS
- Try to use as many actual hugo features as possble, at least where it makes sense
- Make tags work and have some sort of search on the site

Overall I'm pretty motivated because this time around I'm not rushing to get a basic working version of the site out as 
quickly as possible - instead I'm going to working on a separate branch and only switch to the new version of the site 
once it really is finished. I'll try to really take my time and set up this site as something I can build upon for years.

And from a dev perspective - I'll try to work with WSL since I'm now using windows on my main computer again. So this can 
be a practice project to get used to working with WSL and connecting to it locally within VSCode.
