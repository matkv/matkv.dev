I've been interested in personal knowledge base systems recently. After reading about several different ones, I've decided to give **Obsidian** a shot & try moving all my existing notes there & set up an Obsidian vault from scratch.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a personal knowledge base that is based on **markdown files**. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to give it a shot. While the software itself isn't open source, it at least doesn't use a proprietary format that would keep me locked into their system if they ever decide to give up development on the app.

The whole idea of Obsidian is to create **links** between notes in order to connect them by topic - this can then also be shown in a pretty fancy graph.

From playing around with it a bit yesterday & today, I'm pretty impressed so far. It has a couple nice plugins + support for community plugins - for example I already have one installed for Git integration which lets me comfortably back up this whole vault to a private GitHub repository.

I'm still deciding how to set it up in general & I want to make sure to only add notes & content that are actually still relevant to me now. I could probably also use Obsidian as my main way to write the content for this website - Hugo also uses Markdown files for the main content. So I could basically mirror everything on here & just publish the content that I'd actually want to be publicly accessible.

I'm curious if I'll actually stick to it and continue using it. I really like the idea of having all my notes in one place.
