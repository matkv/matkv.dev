Apart from building this website, I've been struggling to find a programming project that I am really passionate about. This page is supposed to help me to find ideas for some fun & useful projects!

* **Lichess stats** - a cli tool that shows statistics and basic information about any player on Lichess. Maybe using [tui](https://docs.rs/tui/latest/tui/) to build the UI in the command line & communicating with the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api) to fetch the data.

* **Changelog generator** - a program that creates changelog files in the exact format that I need for this website. The program should look at all the commits in a git repo and automatically create these files.
