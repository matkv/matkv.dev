This is a collection of interesting/fun/useful websites I found over time. I'm just starting to set up this list so it's very incomplete for now.

### General

### Blogs

### Tools

- [https://exercism.org](https://exercism.org) - open source programming learning platform, non profit, no paid features at all + it has its own cli tool that let's you comfortably **download and submit exercises from your local machine/editor**

- [https://omnivore.app/](https://omnivore.app/home) - my "read-later" app of choice. open source, no paid features (for now) and it has it's own Obsidian plugin to import saved articles into Obsidian
