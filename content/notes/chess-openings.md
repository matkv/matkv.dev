# Tactical vs. Positional openings

[Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vScs84UlQpEP-dsde2HeSmDgDTTgK9LLQW9N1aNbE05jhjPskyEbiHSk_CTgIcbIShV7qywws8Vy_7H/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.ged614816f3_1_168) to the Google Presentation for an overview of chess openings that I found on Reddit.

**To-Do**: look up if I can embed lichess games directly here on the site using [this](https://lichess.org/developers).

## Tactical opening

* Usually sharp & typically open position
* Often many pawns have been traded off
* Gambit openings (willingly sacrificing material to gain lead in development)
* Tends to require more theory
* Gambits are good for players that love to sacrifice material & work well against unprepared players, especially in speed chess (blitz, bullet)

## Positional opening

* Often closed position
* Pawns blocking each other in the center
* Gradual improvement by maneuvering
* Depriving opponents pieces of active squares, preparing pawn breaks
* Play tends to be slow paced, knowledge of general strategy is more important than memorizing theory

# System based vs. Theory based openings

## System based

- The same piece setup -  regardless what the opponent plays (more or less)
    - Flexible move order
    - Less chance of committing a serious blunder in the opening
- Often leads to more passive and defensive positions
- May lead to playing "mindless" chess
- You can learn the same position over and over
    - Well suited for beginners, for **long-term development** it might be a bad idea though

## Theory based

- Usually requires players to memorize some concrete lines
- Most tactical openings are theory-based
- Useful for people with good memory, especially tactical openings with many traps

# Classical vs. Hypermodern openings

## Classical

- Physically occupying the center with pawns
- Use center pawns to maintain a space advantage

## Hypermodern

- Not necessary to directly occupy the center
- Instead controlling the center from a distance using pieces
- Trying to lure the opponent to over-extend their center pawns
- Often uses **fianchetto**, bishop controls the central squares at a safe distance
- More cramped positions, trickier and less intuitive to play well - however the positional challenge can be a natural step in chess development


# Openings with 1.e4 - King's Pawn Game

Why? 

* Occupies center with a pawn
* Controls the center - d5 and f5
* Opens diagonal for queen and light-square bishop
* Typically leads to more **agressive** and **tactical** games

## Open Game - Openings with 1.e4 e5

### Italian Game

* one of the oldest classical openings for white
* flexible - can be sharp, slow and positional
* theoretical - requires preparation
* opponents will have experience with it

Some ideas in the Italian Game:

* White wants to play the d4 pawn break to open the position
* White preserves the light square bishop by playing a3 (making space for it on a2)
* The knight on b1 can be re-routed to the kingside by playing Nbd2 to f1 to g3 and later to f5
* Black has attacking chances on the kingside involving their dark-square bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal

Commong lines:

* 3..Bc5 - **Giuoco Piano**
    * 4.c3 - **Classical Variation**
    * 4.d3 - **Guoco Pianissimo**
    * 4.b4 - **Evans Gambit**
* 3..Nf6 - **Two Knights Defense**
    * 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7! - **Fried Liver Attack**
