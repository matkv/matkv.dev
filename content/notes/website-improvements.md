website"

Some ideas for content that I want to put on this website:

### To-Do

- [ ] a digital cv - either just hosting a PDF or writing some custom css to format everything nicely
- [ ] changelog for this website
- [ ] maybe a page about this website in general and why I created it / why I'm using it
- [ ] add ways to contact me (maybe /contact page)
- [ ] add a page for my to-read list
- [ ] general clean-up of the archetypes, layouts and css
- [ ] maybe switch to just having a thicker separator between menu and main content, maybe also show all page titles in uppercase
- [ ] try grouping the books on the reading page by year, with a little header for each year
- [ ] find a way to add tags to blog posts & notes and make them searchable
- [ ] add reading time to blog posts

### Done 

- [x] a personal blog
- [x] page with information about myself
- [x] a reading list & place to review books I've read, basically an online library / bookshelf,
maybe a way to replace my Goodreads account
- [x] programming side projects
- [x] a custom bookmarks page for websites and links I commonly use (maybe just one big html table)
- [x] page for random notes
- [x] maybe switch the domain to "matkv.dev" (when my current domain runs out, so probably in October?) + I could keep my current domain, especially for the e-mail and just forward to the website on the new domain
