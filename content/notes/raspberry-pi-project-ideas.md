it isn't used as a torrent box anymore"

- mirror of my GitHub profile with regularly scheduled backups or just a local git server
- a syncthing device with local harddrive
- Kodi / Plex client (but I wouldnâ€™t really be able to watch 4K content because the Raspberry probably won't be powerful enough to play it without stuttering)
