it isn't used as a torrent box anymore"
---

* mirror of my GitHub profile with regularly scheduled backups or just a local git server
* a syncthing device with local harddrive
* Kodi / Plex client (but I wouldn’t really be able to watch 4K content because the Raspberry probably won't be powerful enough to play it without stuttering)
