description: Note about my current chess progress & goals
---

This note is about my current chess progress and what I'm trying to work on next.

### Current goals

- Play slower games (focus on Rapid chess)
- Consider trying out Classical games
- Learn one opening for white & one for black

### Bad habits to give up

- Avoiding queen trades even if I'd be in a better position after the trade
- Focusing too much on trying to find checkmate with my available pieces if
I have a passed pawn
