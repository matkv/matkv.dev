I changed the domain for this website! It can now be reached at [matkv.dev](https://matkv.dev). Previously it was my full name + ".com" but I decided to change it because I feel more comfortable sharing this domain on various sites without having to actually reveal my full name.

However, my old domain still works & now just redirects to this new one - I think I'll keep paying for it just so that nobody else can steal it from me :D And it's also nice to have a fairly professional looking email address that I can use this way.

The setup itself was a breeze, I was able to basically just copy the settings from my old domain and set them for the new one. So far everything works as expected.

A fun fact that I learned, when using a domain with the **.dev** top level domain, you apparently **have** to use https & a SSL certificate. But this was pretty easy to set up with my domain provider. All in all, I'm happy with the result!
