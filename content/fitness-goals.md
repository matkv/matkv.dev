I feel like I haven't been taking my fitness seriously enough recently so I'm writing down my goals and habits I want to build again to remind myself what I want to focus on.

I'd rather focus on few goals that I take very seriously than trying to completely through my routine and life around and then fail to stick to it in the end.

## Goals September 2024

- Run 3x per week
- Strength / calisthenics 3x per week (alternatively bouldering)
- Get leaner - **Completely** cut out sweets, snacks and unhealthy drinks for now
- Regular stretching and focus on recovery
- Healthier sleep schedule (asleep by 23:15 during the week)
