Wanted a change of pace so I read a thriller / crime novel for the first time in quite a while. The book started pretty action-packed but then slowed down in the first third and lost me for a couple of weeks which means that it took me a while to finish.

After giving it another shot it managed to hook me and the conclusion to the plot lines was satisfying but felt a little bit rushed. But the main two characters are really likable even if they're a bit cliche. Also everyone seems to sleep with everyone in this book, lol.

I'm now already reading the next one in the main trilogy and I'm liking it even more than this one - it's definitely a page turner.
