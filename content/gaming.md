Games I'm currently enjoying.

## Balatro

A deckbuilder where you try to combine cards into the best poker hand in order to win against increasingly stronger "blinds". Additionally there's joker cards that let you improve your run. Didn't think I'd like it as much as I do but it's really addictive.

## Counter Strike 2

I both love and hate this game. It's still fun but solo queueing can be frustrating. But it's still my most played game on Steam.

## Cyberpunk 2077

Held off from buying it at first because I did not think it would run well on my PC, but got it during the Steam summer sale and it runs pretty well after all, definitely playable. Love the setting and the main story has been interesting and I am really playing it slowly and roleplaying it a bit. Lots of options for customization and Night City has been really fun to explore so far.

## Battlefield 3

After playing through Battlefield 1 I wanted to try out some of the older games in the series and I already had Battlefield 3 in my library. Played through the campaign in one sitting and have been messing around in the multiplayer a bit but I get stomped by the other players there :D

## Rocket League

Got back into RL a bit. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself. It feels really good to play with teammates that rotate and try to play together, but unfortunately that's very rare. Have been rage-quitting a lot so I should probably not really focus on this game haha.

## Hades

Didn't think I'd like it because I'm not so interested in the setting but it's growing on me. I like how you can improve your runs and the different weapons require different playstyles. Also a very pretty and smooth feeling game. And the voice acting is great.

## Human Fall Flat

A fun multiplayer "puzzle" game where you have to complete different maps using teamwork. The controls are annoying on purpose and it's fun to sabotage your friends, definitely a recommendation :D
