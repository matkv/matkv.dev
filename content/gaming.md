Games I'm currently enjoying.

## Balatro

A deckbuilder where you try to combine cards into the best poker hand in order to win against increasingly stronger "blinds". Additionally there's joker cards that let you improve your run. Didn't think I'd like it as much as I do but it's really addictive.

## Counter Strike 2
I both love and hate this game. It's still fun but solo queueing can be frustrating. But it's still my most played game on Steam.

## Hades

Didn't think I'd like it because I'm not so interested in the setting but it's growing on me. I like how you can improve your runs and the different weapons require different playstyles. Also a very pretty and smooth feeling game. And the voice acting is great.

## Human Fall Flat

A fun multiplayer "puzzle" game where you have to complete different maps using teamwork. The controls are annoying on purpose and it's fun to sabotage your friends, definitely a recommendation :D
