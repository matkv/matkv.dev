This is my first introduction to stoicism and actually the first book on philosophy in general that I read. I read the Gregory Hayes translation which helped a lot - I first tried an older translation that was unecessarily difficult to understand when you're used to modern English.

I found many of the ideas in the book quite interesting and insightful even though I don't agree with all of them. At times the book was quite dry & repetitive but I guess that is to be expected when talking about this topic. Overall I liked it and it was neat to actually read the private notes of a Roman emperor that lived almost 2000 years ago. You don't get to do that every day.
