My first book by Nabokov. My main thoughts: super pretty and flowery writing style - sometimes hard to read for me as a non native English speaker (then again neither was Nabokov). 

My main problem with the book wasn't even the obviously problematic/disturbing relationship between the two main characters but mostly that I just didn't really care for the story at some point. I actually took a break of several months before finally finishing this book. There are definitely some quite fucked up scenes & situations in the book; I also didn't think that this book is in any way romanticizing the relationship of the two characters. Humbert knows what he's doing and that what he is doing isn't right, it's just the fact that he's an unreliable narrator that might make this a bit less clear I guess.

Overall, I found it okay. Very pretty writing style, didn't love the story & probably won't reread it.
