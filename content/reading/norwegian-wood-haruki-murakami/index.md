Really unique writing style, the story itself wasn't actually a big part of the book. I felt like the relationships between the characters were the main focus. Definitely felt quite relatable at times.

One thing I found off-putting was the overly sexual themes at times. Seems like the main character has a sexual relationship with pretty much every other female character he interacts with. Kind of felt forced/unfitting more often than not.
