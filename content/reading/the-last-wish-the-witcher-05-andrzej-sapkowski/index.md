Went into this one with really high expectations but while I overall enjoyed it, the fact that it consists of several more or less separate stories rather than one cohesive story was kind of off putting.

I wanted to learn more about the Witcher universe before playing the game or watching the show but after finishing this one I just didn't really feel the itch to continue with the series. I might give it another shot though at some point!
