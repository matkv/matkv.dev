Finally done with the third book in the Wheel Of Time series! This one actually took me quite a long time - I started reading it on November 7th of last year. Especially in the first second quarter of the book it got kind of slow in my opinion which made me take several breaks and read other short books in the meantime.

This is the first book so far that actually wasn't focused primarily on Rand. The focus is mostly on Perrin + Thom (who is back again, wohoo) and Egwene + Nynaeve + Elayne. And we are introduced to a new character called Faile/Zarine, really liked her!

All in all I liked the book, my main criticism would be (as with the first book) the ending. We get around 700 pages of build-up and then the ending felt rushed again. I'm looking forward to the next one, apparently that one is one of the best in the series (not "The Dragon Reborn" as I assumed first, I mixed them up). But it's over 1000 pages so it will take me quite a while :D
