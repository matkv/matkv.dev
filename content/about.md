I'm Matko, a 31 year old software developer from Austria. My main interests are programming, music (guitar & piano), exercising - mainly strength training and running and occasionally bouldering, reading, playing chess and gaming.

I also have a [personal wiki](https://wiki.matkv.dev) for general notes and tutorials that I want to have publicly available.
