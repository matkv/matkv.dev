- [core](https://github.com/matkv/core) - A tool to make some common personal tasks easier - mostly a Go practice project that runs some CLI commands & a SvelteKit web app.
- [tidysync](https://github.com/matkv/tidysync) - A tool to automatically clean up & move files after SyncThing finishes syncing them. Project for learning Rust.
- [wiki](https://wiki.matkv.dev) - My personal wiki, built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).
