I haven't really been keeping up with writing [reviews](/reading) for the books I read on here. The last review I did immediately after finishing the book was book 4 of The Wheel of Time and now I'm already at book 13.

So I want to get back into writing them regularly, but I've also thought about changing how I do them overall. I think it makes more sense to **limit the book reviews to just a couple of sentences** and just write about my **actual thoughts** on the book instead of trying to summarise the plot as well. This way I'll probably also be more motivated to actually write them and keep my reading list up to date.
