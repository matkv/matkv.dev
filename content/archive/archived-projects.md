## Archived projects

These are some projects that I've finished or abandoned:

- [playlist-quickadd](https://github.com/matkv/playlist-quickadd) - Tool to help me manage my Spotify playlists. (Currently I'm not sure if I'm going to continue with this project because the Spotify API doesn't seem to be suitable for what I want to do with this app)
- [nobite](https://github.com/matkv/nobite) - Small tool to prevent nail biting by sending regular notifications.
- [beep](https://github.com/matkv/beep) - A small program that plays a sound when clicking an icon in the system tray / tray bar.
- [HabitTracker](https://github.com/matkv/HabitTracker) - Flutter app for tracking personal habits.
- [IMDBRandomMovie](https://github.com/matkv/IMDBRandomMovie) - Console application which automatically selects a random movie from your IMDB watchlist using Selenium & Python.
