This year, I want to focus on being more deliberate with what kind of books I read and movies I watch.

As far as reading is concerned, I've spent the last couple of years reading a lot of fantasy, especially long fantasy series (Harry Potter, Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive). I'm currently finishing up the first arc of the Stormlight Archive books, Wind and Truth (currently at 30% even though I read over 570 pages haha). But once I'm done with that, I want to shift my focus a bit.

For movies, I want to make more progress on going through my watchlist on IMDB. Currently I have 156 movies on there and I really want to make it a habit to watch at least 1-2 per week. Additionally I want to go to the cinema more often. I've been there a couple times last year as a sort of self-care day and I enjoyed it a lot.

## Reading focus

- Standalone books
- Reading a wider variety of genres
- Reading more "classics" but also contemporary books
- For now, focusing on shorter books
- Non-fiction books on the side
- Not starting any fantasy series

## Movies & TV-Shows focus

- Movies on my watchlist
- Rewatching some movies I've enjoyed in the past
- Going to the cinema more often
