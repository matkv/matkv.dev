Automatically clean up & move files after Syncthing finishes syncing them. Project for learning Rust. I will probably try to use the [Syncthing REST API](https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/rest.html) for this.
 
I haven't started with this project yet because I need to learn more of the Rust basics first.
