This website, built using the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
<!--more-->
The [project repository](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website) for this site uses a GitHub action to **automatically build and deploy** the site to GitHub pages. This basically lets me use & work on this site without necessarily needing a local hugo install. 

Apart from the script for the dark mode functionality, it has been completely written by myself!
