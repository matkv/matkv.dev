This website, built using the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

<!--more-->

The [project repository](https://github.com/matkv/matkv.dev) for this site uses a GitHub action to **automatically build and deploy** the site to GitHub pages. This basically lets me use & work on this site without necessarily needing a local hugo install.

Apart from the script for the dark mode functionality, it has been completely written by myself!

The actual website can be reached at [matkv.dev](https://matkv.dev) and its GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/matkv/matkv.github.io).
